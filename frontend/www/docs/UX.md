_UX_ will be what our contestants see most of the time, as it is the face of _Arena_. Its responsibilities are:



### • Display the contest environment

### • Show, submit, and review problem submissions

### • Display both a mini scoreboard and a scoreboard (maybe even a fancy little graph!)  
i) view of mini scoreboard:

A design decision is that UX will be written 100% in HTML/JavaScript/VueJs (regardless of Arena version), so it can be used with both _Arena_ and _Frontend_ for V1, V2 (current version).
