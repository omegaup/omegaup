_UX_ will be what our contestants see most of the time, as it is the face of _Arena_. Its responsibilities are:

* Display the contest environment.
* Show, submit, and review problem submissions.
* Display clarifications.
* Handle problem submissions.
* Display both a mini and a macro scoreboard (maybe even a fancy little graph!).
* Display standings.

A design decision is that UX will be written 100% in HTML/JavaScript, so it can be used with both _Arena_ and _Frontend_ for V1.
