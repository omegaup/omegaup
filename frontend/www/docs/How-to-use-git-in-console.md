# Installation

## Windows

- Download the installer **[here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)**.
- In the **Git** folder, find **Git Bash.vbs** and open it — this will launch the console.
- Configure your username with the following command (replace `Name` with your GitHub username):
```
git config --global user.name "Name"
```
- Configure your email with the following command (replace `email` with the email used for your GitHub account):
```
git config --global user.email "email"
```

## Mac

It’s very likely that Git is already installed. To confirm, open the Terminal and run: `git --version`.
If it shows something like `git version 2.3.2` (version numbers may vary), everything is ready.  
If nothing appears, follow the installation instructions **[here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Mac)**.

## Linux

Install Git using one of the following commands:

`sudo yum install git-all` or `sudo apt-get install git-all`


# Clone the Project

- First, fork the project by going to **https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup** and clicking the **Fork** button.
- Then, in your console, run: `git clone https://github.com/username/omegaup.git`(Replace `username` with your GitHub username.)
