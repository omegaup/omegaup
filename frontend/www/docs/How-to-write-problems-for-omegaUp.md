# How to Create Problems for omegaUp

Thank you very much for your interest in adding content to the omegaUp platform. There are two ways to create problems for omegaUp:

* **omegaUp CDP**: The [Problem Creator (CDP)](https://omegaup.com/problem/creator) is a visual tool that allows you to create problems in a very intuitive and user-friendly way. This tool has some limitations (for example, it does not support Karel problems). If this tool does not meet your needs, we recommend considering the option described in the next point. You can access the Problem Creator through [this link](https://omegaup.com/problem/creator). We also recommend watching [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUUP9DqQ1Vg) that teaches you how to use it.

* **Manual Generation of the `.zip` File**: This option is recommended for cases where the Problem Creator mentioned above does not cover all your needs. In [this section of the wiki](https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup/blob/main/frontend/www/docs/Generaci%C3%B3n-Manual-de-Archivo-.zip-para-Problemas.md), we explain how to manually generate a `.zip` file that you can upload to [omegaUp](https://omegaup.com/problem/new/) to create your problem on the platform. We also recommend watching [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfyRSsgrvNc) that shows the process step by step.
