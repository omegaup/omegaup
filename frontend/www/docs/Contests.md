##Types of Contests based on admission mode##

**Open/Registration Contests**
+ Any user can register for the contest.
+ Only participants admitted by the admins have the access.

**Closed/Private Contest**
+ I have a list of email addresses of the users who will participate.
+ I am organizing a contest where I don’t know the contestants, and I will distribute pre-generated usernames and passwords myself. This can be done with the help of omegaUp's [Identities manager](https://blog.omegaup.com/features/docentes/administracion-de-identidades/#cómo-funciona-la-administración-de-identidades) tool, which allows organizers to generate user accounts in bulk and manage their access to contests efficiently. 

**Public Contest**
+ Any user can register for the contest and anyone can participate.
