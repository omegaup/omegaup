Once you [installed your dev environment](https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup/wiki/How-to-Set-Up-Your-Development-Environment-(English)) and you made the changes you wish to propose, follow these steps:

# Previous settings

- The virtual machine does not have `en_US.UTF-8` as the default language. To update it you have to do what is described in [this link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/881742/locale-cannot-set-lc-ctype-to-default-locale-no-such-file-or-directory-locale/893586#893586).

- At first, there are many missing dependencies. You need to run `composer install` inside the VM to install them.

- If you made changes in the UI and you don't see them in `localhost:8080`, it is important to run: `yarn install && yarn run dev`

# Before a pull request

*  Clone the repository `https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup` onto `https://github.com/<your-username>/omegaup` by clicking on the "Fork" button:![](https://image.ibb.co/k3Oh9v/Screenshot_from_2017_08_06_22_10_12.png)

**Before starting to make modifications** run these commands to create a new branch that is synchronized with `omegaup` repository:

* `git checkout main` # Switch you to main branch.
* `git fetch upstream` # Download the  omegaup/main repository.
* `git checkout -b newfeaturename upstream/main` # Create new branch.
* `git push pr newfeaturename`  # Push the new branch to your fork.

# Upload your changes and made a new Pull Request

Follow the next steps:

* Add your changes to a new commit: 
`git add .`

* Commit your changes:
`git commit -m "Write your description."`

* Set up your user information (You only need to enter this information the first time you push):
    * `git config --global user.email "your-email@domain.com"`
    * `git config --global user.name "<your-username>"`

* Push from your commit to your fork: 
`git push -u pr`


* Go to https://github.com/your-username/omegaup, click on the button _Branch_ [0] and select the branch you made changes _newfeaturename_[1.1]. After click on _Pull request_[2]:

Alternatively, if you are in the omegaUp repository or yours, you can press the [1.2] button and then press the _Pull request_ [2] button.

*Fill in the required information and press the "Create Pull request" button

If you have to make more changes after making the Pull Request, follow this steps:  
  
* Add your changes to a commit:  
`git add .`  
  
* Add your commit:  
`git commit -m" Put a description of the changes here. "`  
  
* Push from your commit to your fork:  
`git push`

# Delete a branch

You can see the branches that you have in your local copy by running `git branch`. You can switch between branches by doing `git checkout branchname`.  
  
If we have already merged a Pull Request, you can clean your local branch with `git branch -D branchname`, but you also have to go to GitHub and delete the branch there (by clicking on" Branches ") or directly on the Pull Request.

After this, you will still see the remote branch if you run the command `git branch -a`. You will find a line similar to:  
```  
remotes/pr/newfeaturename 
```
You can delete it in the following way:  
  
* Enter the following command `git remote prune pr --dry-run`, then it will ask you to enter your credentials. You will see something similar to this:  
```
[would prune] pr/newfeaturename 
```
  
* Now enter the command `git remote prune pr`, re-enter your credentials. You will see something similar to this:  
```
Pruning pr  
URL: git@github.com: pabo99/omegaup.git  
* [pruned] pr/newfeaturename 
```
  
If you run the command `git branch -a` again you will notice that everything related to `newfeaturename` has already disappeared.
