# Ideas List #

## Quality Contents: Add quality and difficulty measurement for contests

**Brief description**:

Recently we introduced the capability of gathering feedback from users about a problem right after they solve it. Explicitly, we ask for quality, difficulty and topics related to the task. We aggregate that feedback every night and show a measurement of quality and difficulty as well as a list of tags for each problem to users looking at the [problem list](https://omegaup.com/problem/?query=&language=all&order_by=difficulty&mode=desc). In this project we want to the same kind of feedback about contests and show aggregations of that data to users looking for [contests](https://omegaup.com/arena/) to participate in.

**Expected results**:

Users participating in contests should be asked for feedback about the contest and users looking for a contest to participate in should see quality, difficulty and topic tags attached to each contest.

**Preferred skills**:
  * PHP
  * SQL
  * Python

## Quality Contents: Show quality and difficulty histograms

**Brief description**:

Recently we introduced the capability of gathering feedback from users about a problem right after they solve it. Explicitly, we ask for quality (a number between 1 and 5), difficulty (another number between 1 and 5) and topics related to the task. We aggregate that feedback every night and show a measurement of quality and difficulty as well as a list of tags for each problem to users looking at the [problem list](https://omegaup.com/problem/?query=&language=all&order_by=difficulty&mode=desc). The measurements of quality and difficulty are computed by taking a bayesian average of the data gathered from the users, we need to also compute and show the % of people who voted for each of the 5 possible values.

**Expected results**:

Users browsing the [problem list](https://omegaup.com/problem/?query=&language=all&order_by=difficulty&mode=desc) will see a histogram of the votes that the problem received for quality and for difficulty.

**Preferred skills**:

  * Python

## Problem suggestions

**Brief description**:

It is difficult for any person to wade through the thousands of problems available to solve in the platform. It would be very helpful to have a way to suggest what problems to solve next. Two potential use cases would be to suggest problems appropriate for a persons' skill level for students that are trying to learn new skills by themselves, and for teachers to be able to request problems that are similar in nature to another in order to refresh their courses after each school term.

**Expected results**:

Build a service that given a set of problems (either the problems that a particular user has solved, or a set of problems that a teacher wants to be similar), and a corpus of available problems, and data about what users have solved what problems, can return a small set of next problems to try.

**Preferred skills**:
  * PHP
  * SQL
  * Python
  * Machine Learning

## Plagiarism detector

**Brief description**:

Whenever there is an online contest/programming course, there is the risk of participants cheating by sharing their solution amongst themselves. This is currently done in a very ad-hoc way (by manually inspecting all submissions that have similar scores) and taking into account which students get along with which other students, which does not scale. It would be very beneficial to have a report of similarity that is generated at the end of each contest/course. This can be achieved by calling a service such as [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/).

**Expected results**:

Build a service that manages a queue of plagiarism analysis requests. Each request is a set of code submissions that will be uploaded to the plagiarism analysis service. Once the analysis is finished, it should be transformed in a way that can be presented to the user.

**Preferred skills**:
  * PHP
  * SQL
  * Python

## Ghost mode for contests

**Brief description**:

Students seeking to participate in competitions (such as state or national informatics olympiads) oftentimes replay the previous versions of that same competition at omegaUp.com as part of their training (that is, they solve exactly the same problems and under the same time constraints, etc). We want to offer a more realistic to contest replay by also showing a replay of the scoreboard exactly as recorded during the original competition.

Given a contest that has already finished, you should be able to select it and create a new contest based on it. Once the contest starts, a virtual timer will start running. The scoreboard of this new contest will merge the current standings with the standings of the original contest that corresponds with the virtual timer.

The name "Ghost mode" was chosen due to its similarity with the feature found in [Mario Kart](https://www.mariowiki.com/Ghost_(Mario_Kart)).

**Expected results**:

Students replaying any past competition will be able to see a replay of the scoreboard exactly as recorded during the original competition. This can be done mostly on the client-side to avoid having to update the database and/or invalidate caches.

**Preferred skills**:
  * JavaScript
  * PHP
  * SQL

# How to Write Your Application #
Before start writing your proposal, we hope you are familiar with our development environment and code since that makes it easier to understand our project ideas. Craft a design document for your project using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FKfpc2M3VLDVYqvT8ZgsgwIJ3zaZnyUVmSm-H3h6UQ/edit). If you want to work in two projects, write one proposal with one design followed by the other. 

We also encourage you to **send us your draft proposal to review and give feedback**. Send the link of your draft to `googlesummerofcode@omegaup.com`. Make sure that the subject says *Proposal* and that anyone with the link can see and comment. 

When you consider that your application is ready, don't forget to **send it to [Google](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/age-verification/student/?next=%2Fstudent-signup%2F)** because if you don't do it, you will not be able to be considered in GSoC 2018.

# Frequently Asked Questions #
* **The development environment installation script is throwing me an error.** Please file a bug to the [deploy repository](https://github.com/omegaup/deploy/issues) and make sure to include your reproduction steps and the error you are getting.
* **Am I expected to speak Spanish?** Not at all. We try our best to be as inclusive as possible to non-Spanish volunteers. Please feel free to use English everywhere in our communication channels and in your code. We have also found Google Translate to do a decent job in assisting with translations of the things we have written in the past.
* **Do you have a mailing list where I can ask more questions?** Yes! Please join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/omegaup-soporte). You can also ask questions on our 
* **How do you choose your students?** We will review each application that we receive and will choose one or two (depending on how many good proposals and mentors we find) based on two things:
    * Candidate's skill level. There are two good ways to show your skill level in your application: Through impactful pull requests sent to our repositories (this is the recommended way), or through previous experience. Make sure to include evidence of at least one of those in your application.
    * Candidate's work plan. We ask you to write a high level design of your project following our [proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FKfpc2M3VLDVYqvT8ZgsgwIJ3zaZnyUVmSm-H3h6UQ/edit)
* **Can I propose solution to multiple problems from the ideas list?** Of course! We actually expect and encourage candidates to solve one of the problems marked as "easy" and then move onto a more challenging one, both during the solution proposal phase and during the the coding phase.
* **Are there more opportunities for me if I don't get selected for GSoC?** Of course there are. We always welcome new volunteers who are interested in supporting our efforts. Around the time when proposal submission ends, we will announce a plan to onboard those of you how are interested in becoming volunteers.
