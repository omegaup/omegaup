# Recruitment and Training of New Volunteers for the Engineering Team

## Introduction

Over the years that omegaUp has existed, and especially in more recent years, we have received multiple requests from potential volunteers interested in contributing to omegaUp's code. Until now, we have handled these requests on a case-by-case basis. In many cases, we have fallen short in capitalizing on the potential of these volunteers, often due to a lack of early training and support.

The specifications in this document are intended to describe the process that the vast majority of these candidates must follow to join the team. There will still be exceptions, including but not limited to:

- Internship students who arrive with a contract for a specific period. These individuals receive a monetary stipend, go through a technical interview process, and require an official agreement with their school.
- Former volunteers with a recognized record of contributions who are interested in returning.

## Summary

We are launching a training process for new volunteers that will be open to anyone interested. Once the person meets the requirements, they will be invited to join omegaUp's engineering team.

## Description

The GitHub repository, where we manage all our code, is always open for anyone in the world to submit proposals for changes to the code. And it has always been that way.

From now on, we will have a training process for new volunteers, which consists of consuming the following resources:

- Documentation of the code and the software development process we follow at omegaUp: https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup/wiki. This is the main educational resource we have for new contributors.
- [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1PG4Dvje88) on how to install the local development environment.
- The ``#dev_training`` channel on omegaUp's Discord server. In this channel, we offer technical help to those interested in collaborating and who are starting to familiarize themselves with our code and development process. In this channel, you can write in English or Spanish interchangeably.
- List of ["Good first issues"](https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) on GitHub. This is a hand-curated list by the engineering team that contains issues ideal for beginners.
- The ["Good second issues"](https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+second+issue%22) list for those who have already resolved several issues from the first list and are ready for more challenging issues.
- By the end of this year, we expect to have class videos about the structure of our code.

This training phase is always open to anyone without needing to request it.

Once the person has read all the documentation and resolved 5 issues from the ["Good first issues"](https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) list + 5 issues from the ["Good second issues"](https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+second+issue%22) list, they will be formally invited to join the engineering team and will be addressed as volunteers with an @omegaup.com email account if they so desire.
