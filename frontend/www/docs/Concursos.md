##Types of Contests##

**Open Contests**
+ Contestants register on the website themselves. Anyone can participate in the contest.

**Closed Contest**
+ I have a list of email addresses of the users who will participate.
+ I am organizing a contest where I donâ€™t know the contestants, and I will distribute pre-generated usernames and passwords myself.
