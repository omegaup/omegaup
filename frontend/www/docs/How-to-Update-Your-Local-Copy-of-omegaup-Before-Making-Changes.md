# How to Update Your Local Copy of omegaUp Before Making Changes

Keeping your local repository synchronized with the main omegaUp repository ensures that you always work with the latest code and helps prevent merge conflicts.  
Follow these steps before starting any new development work.

## 1. Add the Main Repository as a Remote

If you have not already added the main omegaUp repository as a remote named `upstream`, run:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/omegaup/omegaup.git
