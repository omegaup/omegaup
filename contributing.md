# GitHub Guidelines



## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Subject Line Requirements
- **Cannot be empty** - All commits must have a subject line
- **Length**: Must be between 2-999 characters
- **Format**: Must be a single line (no line breaks)

- **Line length**: All body lines must be shorter than 1000 characters

### Examples

```

‚ùå **Bad commit subjects:**
```

A# Too short (only 1 character)

Add user authentication system.  # Ends with period (not allowed)

This is a very long commit message that exceeds the maximum allowed length and goes on and on about various changes made to the codebase without being concise and to the point which makes it harder to read and understand quickly  # Too long (over 1000 characters)
```

- Keep the subject line descriptive but concise
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Use the body to explain *what* and *why*, not *how*

### Pull Requests
- Link to relevant issues using keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456"
- Include screenshots for visual changes
- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting review

### Issues
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Provide enough context for others to understand the problem
- Include steps to reproduce for bugs
- Tag issues appropriately with labels
