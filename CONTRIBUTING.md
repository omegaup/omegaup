# Contributing to omegaUp

Thank you for your interest in contributing to omegaUp! 
This document explains how to get started as a contributor, follow project workflows, and submit changes for review.

---

## Before You Start

If you are not confident using Git, we recommend reading an introductory Git tutorial before contributing.

To set up the development environment, run the project locally, and troubleshoot issues, please refer to:

📘 **Development Environment Setup Guide**  
`frontend/www/docs/Development-Environment-Setup-Process.md`

This guide contains detailed instructions for Docker setup, running tests, authentication, and troubleshooting.

---

## Issue Assignment Workflow

omegaUp uses an automated issue assignment workflow to keep contributions fair and active.

- Use `/assign` to self-assign an issue.
- You may have up to **3 active assignments** at a time.
- A Pull Request (**Draft PR is acceptable**) must be opened within **7 days** of assignment.
- Issues without PR activity may be automatically unassigned.

📘 For full details, see:  
`frontend/www/docs/Issue-Assignment-Workflow.md`

## Working on an Issue

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make focused, incremental commits
4. Open a Draft PR if work is in progress

Branch naming examples:
- `docs/add-contributing-md`
- `fix/login-validation`
- `feat/problem-editor-ui`

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

- `docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `fix: correct submission validation`
- `feat: improve problem editor UX`

---

## Pull Request Process

- Open Pull Requests against the `main` branch
- Link the related issue in the PR description (e.g. `Addresses #162`)
- Use Draft PRs for work in progress
- Ensure CI checks pass before requesting review
- Keep PRs focused and avoid unrelated refactors

---

## Documentation and Translations

- Documentation improvements are welcome
- Avoid duplicating existing documentation
- Translation changes should follow existing localization patterns

---

## Getting Help

If you need help:
- Ask in the issue you’re working on
- Open a discussion or issue for clarification

We appreciate your contributions and collaboration
