- Use formal register appropriate for educational content

**Portuguese Translation:**
- Use "algoritmo" for algorithm, "complexidade" for complexity  
- "Análise do Problema" for Problem Analysis
- "Abordagem da Solução" for Solution Approach
- "Passos do Algoritmo" for Algorithm Steps
- Use Brazilian Portuguese formal register

## Quality Standards:
- Each translation must be complete and comprehensive
